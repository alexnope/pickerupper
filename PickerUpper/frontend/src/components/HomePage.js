                        <p>The problem we aim to solve is lack of information and communication between people planning a pick up game, and potential players. Traditionally, players would become aware of the existance of pick up games through word of mouth, or finding one by luck. This made it very hard for players to find games, especially players that were new in town (or just staying temporarily), didn't know many people, or just getting into the sport. We wanted to create a resource where players could not easily find pick up games to join, but also start their own. Thus, we created Picker Upper.</p>
